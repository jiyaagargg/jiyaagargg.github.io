<p>I have selected the MIT LICENSE because of its flexibilty, as it allows any user to upadate or modify the work  This freedom would allow to collaborate with individuals having similar interests and it would not only help them but also their contributions would be beneficial for me. The diverse usage cuts the restrictions that are often used in other licenses. </p>
